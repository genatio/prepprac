This is the official repository for the Preparatory Practice WebApp

# Development Environment Setup.
## Frontend Setup.
### Node.js
For the frontend development of Prepprac, we need to set up Node.js as our
 runtime environment. We will be using version 18.17.0 LTS for its stability 
 and long-term support.

```bash
# Install Node.js version 18.17.0 LTS using Node Version Manager (nvm).
nvm install 18.17.0 --lts

# Confirm the Node.js installation.
node --version
```

### Next.js
Next.js is the framework of choice for building the frontend of our web 
 application due to its efficiency and versatility. We'll create a Next.js
 project with TypeScript for a more structured and type-safe codebase.

```bash
# Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript template.
npx create-next-app@latest -y


# Run application
```
