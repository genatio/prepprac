## Technology.

### Serverless multi-tier applications on AWS cloud.
Architecture pattern where developers can build and deploy multi-tier applications 
without the need to manage traditional servers or infrastructure. 
It involves using AWS managed services for each tier of the application, 
including;

#### Three-tier architecture pattern.
![Architectural pattern for a three-tier application](image.png)
1. The Presentation tier (frontend), will be implemented using AWS Service:
	1. Static web hosting on Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront
2. The Logic tier (backend), will be implemented by using AWS Services: 
	1. API Gateway for APIs with Amazon CloudFront.
	2. Lambda for code functions.
3. The Data tier (database), will be implemented using AWS Service:
	1. Amazon DynamoDB.

#### Other AWS Services to be used.
1. Amazon CloudWatch -near real-time metrics for monitoring API execution.
2. AWS X-Ray - tracing for debugging.
3. AWS WAF - web application firewall which helps protect APIs from attacks.
